### Create an Inheritance Hierarchy

- The task of this exercise is to create an inheritance hierarchy with at least 3 different levels.
- You can choose your classes freely.
- Each class should have at least two different constructors, two fields and some meaningful methods which should be overridden in the subclasses
- then in the main class make multiple instances of each class
- furthermore, show an example of Polymorphism similar to that one we had in our class
